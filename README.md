## Overview

### The challenge

This challenge will be a perfect test of your layout and responsive skills. The challeng focus on HTML & CSS so the isn't a js. The challenge is to build out this chat app and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the component depending on their device's screen size
- **Bonus**: See the chat interface animate on the initial load

I do not have access to the Figma sketch so the design is not pixel perfect.
